        "The simulation tool uses a SIMetrix/SIMPLIS simulation environment, with options to use SPICE or piece wise linear modeling, ",
        "that can cover a very wide set of possible simulation needs. This capable simulation interface is paired with proprietary ",
        "model files from Microchip, to model specific Microchip analog components in addition to generic circuit devices. ",
        "Finally, this simulation tool is installed and runs locally, on the user’s own PC. ",
        "Once downloaded, no internet connection is required, and the run time is not dependent on a remotely located server. ",
        "The result is fast, accurate analog circuit simulations.",
